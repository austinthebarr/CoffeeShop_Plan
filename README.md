# CoffeeShop App

An IOS app allowing users to manage inventory and sales using React-Native

## Project Proposal

CoffeeShop POS

App will be a POS designed for Coffee Shops. Will have inventory integration to allow users to track their inventory while selling drinks.

Features:

Login section
Drink menu
Inventory list
Goal: 
To create a complete front end of POS system.

Framework:

React Native
Extra Features:

Integrate a C# back-end, that would handle user logins, storing users inventory, and storing drinks.
Allow  for users to accept credit card payments
Email Admin if stock becomes low.
Extra Features will require:

C# 
.Net Core Framework
Is there anything else youâ€™d like your instructor to know? 

I hope to accomplish building out the front-end of this Application. I believe this would be a great challenge to transfer my skills of React to React Native.

### Notes
Planning this project was very time consuming. I was happy I only had one stateful component. I am still getting used to React and believe I just need a good chunk of time to really understand best practices of structuring a React app.
